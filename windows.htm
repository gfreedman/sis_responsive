        <h4>Window Options</h4>
        <p>We consider North Star brand windows, manufactured in Canada, to be the best window on the market today.&nbsp; S.I.S has been installing these premium vinyl replacement windows and aluminum-vinyl hybrid windows in Calgary homes since 2007.&nbsp; North Star's manufacturing system ensures that all vinyl windows are built to meet or exceed industry standards including being certified by Energy Star, Window Wise and the American Architectural Manufacturers Association as well as being NAFS (North American Fenestration Standard) and CSA certified. </p>
        <p>These replacement windows are available in numerous different styles and shapes, which can be configured into hundreds of different combinations.&nbsp; We carry the following types of low maintenance/maintenance free North Star windows for you to choose from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>The Vinyl - NS 1000 Series:&nbsp; Our most popular window, the 1000 series with its 3 1/4" frame, is well suited to most applications.&nbsp; Energy efficient and durable, this window is available in a casement, awning, single-hung, double-hung, single-slider, double-slider and custom shape.<br />
            An exciting feature available in this Calgary windows series is the seven exterior laminated colours that are available including: White, Hickory, Ivory, Chestnut brown, Sable, Espresso, Cocoa, Sandalwood.

            </li>

        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>The Aluminum / Vinyl Hybrid series: Architecturally inspired, the hybrid window offers the benefits of both the aluminum window and the all vinyl window in one innovative window system.&nbsp; This durable design unites the clean lines of an aluminum exterior with the easy maintenance and energy efficiency of a vinyl interior.&nbsp; Exterior aluminum colours available are: White, Tan Sand, Slate, Charcoal and Black. Interior window colour is available in white PVC with a vinyl window jamb.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>The All Vinyl - NS 4000/5000 Series:&nbsp; Available in two widths, our 4 1/2" and 5 1/2" full frame window, positions the insulated glass unit on the warm side of the building envelope, for reduced condensation and greater comfort.&nbsp; Available in a casement, awning single hung, single-slider, and custom shape.&nbsp; The all vinyl 4000/5000 series is only available in white for both interior and exterior surfaces.</p>

        <h4>Glass Sealed Unit Technology</h4>
        <p>North Star Windows utilize the exceptional Super Spacer&reg; Technology in their sealed units (glass panes within the window frame).&nbsp; The Super Spacer&reg; system does the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>Resists and virtually eliminates condensation which can lead to mould growth and has been linked to allergies, asthma and respiratory illness.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Boosts R-values by helping to block heat outside or inside heat from passing through the window system - saving you money in heating and cooling costs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Reduces noise - closed-cell polymer foam in SuperSpacer&reg; transmits very little sound compared to conventional metal spacers.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
