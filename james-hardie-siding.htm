        <br />
        James Hardie&reg; siding resists warping, cracking, hail and high winds up to 240 km/h.&nbsp; It is also a non-combustible, flame resistant material that is approved for fire-rated construction.&nbsp; As well, it is insect and woodpecker resistant.&nbsp; Its appearance can be made to mimic just about any other siding material, including wood lap boards, shingles, wood shake siding, and is currently available in 20 ColorPlus&reg; Technology colors as well as 10 colors of Hardie Trim. </p>

        <h4>What is James Hardie siding ColorPlus Technology?</h4>
        <p>James Hardie siding has multiple coats (50 percent more than your average house painter uses) of proprietary finish to every surface and edge of the siding and trim, leaving no spot uncovered.&nbsp; Between coats, the paint finish is cured with a baked-on bond in a controlled environment for an even stronger bond that resists chipping, peeling and cracking.&nbsp; ColorPlus Technology resists fading form UV-Rays&nbsp; and looks good for longer compared with vinyl siding which has a tendency to get brittle and fade in the sun over time.</p>
