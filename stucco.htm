        <h3>Stucco</h3>
        <p>Stucco is a timeless, classic look that has been used for centuries.&nbsp; S.I.S. uses Adex brand polymer-based exterior coatings for those customers that choose the traditional look of stucco in Calgary.&nbsp; This system is known as EIFS or Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems.&nbsp; The benefits of this product are many including its superior durability and energy efficiency as well as its minimal requirement for maintenance under normal conditions.&nbsp; It is available in 300 standard colours and it is also possible to replicate the colour of your choice through a custom order.</p>

        <h4>What makes the EIFS system energy efficient? &nbsp;</h4>
        <p>The new synthetic stucco systems are very energy efficient, because they include an additional insulation layer of expanded polystyrene, (which you may know as Styrofoam), which&nbsp; provides an increased thermal barrier.&nbsp;&nbsp; As per the Adex.ca website, "Expanded polystyrene (EPS) works not only as the backing for the EIFS lamina (base coat, mesh and finish coat), it also provides an R-4 insulation value for every inch of thickness used.&nbsp; For instance, a four inch thickness of EPS will raise the insulation value of your walls to R-16! No other cladding system combines this level of performance and aesthetics."</p>
        <p>In a nutshell the EIFS system is a non-load bearing, composite cladding system that consists of a weather resistant barrier (air and/or vapour barrier); and insulation board attached either adhesively, mechanically, or both, the substrate; an integrally reinforced base coat; and a textured protective finish coat.</p>
        <h4>Colours, Shapes and Textures - The Fun Stuff!&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>The expanded polystyrene foam (EPS)&nbsp; board used in the EIFS system can be molded and shaped into an endless variety of designs.&nbsp; This can dramatically increase the aesthetic value of your home in addition to reducing heating costs.&nbsp; Adex also offers 300 standard colours as well as unlimited custom colours of your choice. In addition, you have a choice of texture for the finish coat on your home.&nbsp; Depending on the look that you desire, the finish or top coat can range from a very fine, smooth texture to a more course, rugged texture.&nbsp; The combinations are endless! </p>
