        <h3>Vinyl Siding</h3>
        <p>Vinyl siding is an affordable alternative to other types of siding and offers style, ease of use, and durability. It is also recyclable and resistant to dents, weather effects, and fading. Vinyl siding is known for its deep, penetrating color, which keeps scratches and blemishes from becoming highly noticeable. It never needs to be scraped or painted like other materials and cleaning is as easy as an occasional spray with a hose or mild detergent. Vinyl siding does not rot, rust or crack and provides an excellent overall value. </p>
