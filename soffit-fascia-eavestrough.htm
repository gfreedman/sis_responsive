        <h3>Soffit, Fascia and Eaves Trough</h3>
        <p>The soffit, fascia and eaves trough are part of the roof of your home but are commonly replaced and updated when replacing the siding of your home.&nbsp; On older homes, the soffit and fascia were wooden and had to be scraped and painted (sometimes every few years - especially if the fascia was facing the sun all day and if painted a darker colour).&nbsp; In Calgary and surrounding communities, we replace the soffit and fascia with maintenance free aluminum materials for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>they will never have to be painted and they will not rot, chip or crack</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>aluminum is non-combustible, in case of fire</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>aluminum is easy to keep clean and does not attract dirt</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Soffit</h4>
        <p>The soffit is the exposed surface beneath the overhanging section of a roof eave.&nbsp; When you are standing directly beside your house and you look up to where the roof line meets the side of your house, you will be looking at the soffit.&nbsp; The soffit can either be vented or solid depending on how your attic is vented to the outside.&nbsp; The vented soffit features aluminum panels with small holes that allow for air circulation into the eaves and attic space.&nbsp; Air circulation is a highly important function as it removes moisture from the attic space that would eventually allow the development of mould growth and wood rot in the sheathing and roof trusses (rafters).</p>
        <h4>Fascia</h4>

        </div>
        <p>The fascia runs perpendicular to the ground.&nbsp; It is the main board on which the eaves trough or rain gutter is mounted and is fixed directly to the roof trusses.&nbsp;&nbsp; It usually does all the work of supporting the bottom row of shingles as well as carrying all the eaves trough.</p>
