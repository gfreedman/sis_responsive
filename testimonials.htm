        "We are absolutely thrilled we chose you guys to do this job. Our gut feel right from the first minute we walked into the booth at the Home and Garden show was that we liked your products and the staff the best and it&rsquo;s proven to be even better than we imagined. We knew absolutely nothing about windows but in the short time in the booth we talked with Garret and Kevin and became educated very fast which helped us a ton when talking to other companies. We talked to many of the other companies and even had 2 other quotes done but we kept coming back to you. SO GLAD WE DID!!! All of the SIS staff we&rsquo;ve worked with is top notch!!!"&nbsp;</p>

        "We have used S.I.S. twice for window replacements with excellent results. Thank you to Leo for helping select the windows, Sian for her quick response to questions or requests I had for her. Ryan &amp; Bill were a pleasure to have on site, very courteous and excellent work ethics, did a great job cleaning the work areas. We will definitely recommend S.I.S. to other people. Thank you!!"</p>

        &ldquo; &hellip;I have dealt extensively with S.I.S. Supply Install Services
        throughout 2008.&nbsp; During this time they have provided me with a range of
        product options, thorough product knowledge, and competitive pricing to
        help with our selection of product and service.&nbsp; Upon selecting S.I.S.
        to assist with our window replacements, a flexible schedule coupled with
        hard-working, competent installation personnel strengthened our
        relationship and promoted repetitive business throughout our entire home
        renovation.&nbsp; Today, a year after our renovations have been complete, we
        frequently receive compliments on the transparent quality of
        workmanship in the final product.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Pat S</strong><br />
        &ldquo;Just wanted to thank the 3 young fellow's who installed our back door
        today, it looks fabulous and all 3 of them are an asset to SIS.&nbsp; The
        pride they took installing the door, and I might add it had its moments,
        they never gave up and they were a real pleasure to have in my home.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Ted D</strong><br />
        &ldquo;We have been most impressed by the professionalism, knowledge and skill
        of all members of the S.I.S. team. From the initial consultation
        through to the final installation of our windows, the S.I.S. team has
        been extremely courteous and helpful in answering all our questions and
        in suggesting possible design alternatives. Their excellent variety of
        window products with the CSA certified rating was a key factor in our
        decision to buy from S.I.S.&nbsp; We heartily recommend S.I.S. for all your
        window renovations and improvements. We will be using them in the near
        future to change more of our home&rsquo;s windows.

        has asked me to pass along a very special thank you to Jeremie for
        being so obliging in dealing with the remaining minor issues. &nbsp;We are
        totally thrilled with the appearance of our "new home". &nbsp;We have
        received many compliments from friends, neighbors and even strangers who

        "I
        want you to know that I was very impressed with the high quality of
        customer service of SIS. &nbsp;I just purchased a couple of screens from you
        guys and I was treated like I had handed you a huge contract. &nbsp;I got the
        impression that no matter how big or small the job you treat your
        customers with equal respect. &nbsp;Thank You Again. &nbsp;In future, I'll be sure
        to look you guys up and also refer you to my friends."</p>
