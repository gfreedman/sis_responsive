        <h3>Calgary Siding and Exterior Finishing</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;Of course each exterior finishing solution from S.I.S. can be partnered with energy saving measures like polyiso insulating sheathing or rigid closed cell foam insulation to improve the R-Value insulating performance of your home.&nbsp; Let our Renovation Consultants guide you through the selection process and help you determine which of our many products is right for your project.</p>

        <p>You can count on our commitment to quality.&nbsp; Often times our crews come across decayed and decomposed wood materials (also known as wood rot) when removing old siding, stucco and windows from Calgary homes. When this happens, you can rest assured that we will remove all of the rotten wood framing, sheathing and other compromised materials such as mouldy insulation.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will then treat the area to kill any remaining spores, if need be, and then rebuild and reframe the walls and seal up your building envelope so that water will not be able to infiltrate into your home again.&nbsp; We have the knowledge and expertise to remediate this type of situation.</p>
        <p>As an exterior renovation specialist, S.I.S. is a leader in the installation and maintenance of a variety of exterior finishing products. A sustainability focused company, we are committed to meeting the highest standards for energy efficiency in all our exterior finishing products.
